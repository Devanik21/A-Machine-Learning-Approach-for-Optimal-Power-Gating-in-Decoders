# A-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Optimal-Power-Gating-in-Decoders
The project uses an ML surrogate model (e.g., Random Forest) to instantly predict a decoder's PPA (Power, Performance, Area) based on design parameters optimizing trade-off, significantly boosting efficiency and enabling a faster, data-driven VLSI design flow , providing a faster, data-driven VLSI design flow.
